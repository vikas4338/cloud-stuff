# EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)
EC2 is a compute service offered by cloud which provide secure and resizable compute service (virtual machine) in cloud. We can secure EC2 instances by configuring/allowing traffic via security groups. 

## EC2 pricing plans
1) **On-Demand Instances:** Pay by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. Ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads1.

2) **Savings Plans:** Save up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing by committing to a consistent amount of usage for a 1- or 3-year term.

3) **Reserved Instances:** Significant discounts (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing with an upfront commitment to a 1- or 3-year term.

4) **Spot Instances:** Take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at discounts of up to 90% compared to On-Demand prices. Best for fault-tolerant and flexible workloads1.

5) **Dedicated Hosts:** Physical servers for your exclusive use, giving you more control over instance placement and allowing you to use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses.
